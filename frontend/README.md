# 🗺️ Product Roadmap (Year 1)

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for the IDOHR platform, moving from a foundational MVP to a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: The Foundation (MVP)

**Goal:** Launch a functional public presence, digitalize intake forms, and seed the database.

- [ ] **Public Website:** Deploy Home, About, Adopt, and Donate pages with responsive mobile-first design.
- [ ] **Digital Intake Operations:** Replace paper forms with a smart `SurrenderPet` form that includes logic to flag behavioral risks (e.g., bite history) automatically.
- [ ] **Volunteer Portal:** Launch the volunteer application with a "Teen vs. Adult" logic gate to handle liability requirements dynamically.
- [ ] **Backend Core:** Initialize the Go server architecture and seed the PostgreSQL database with initial pet and volunteer data.

## 💸 Phase 2: Revenue & Reach

**Goal:** Secure cash flow and syndicate data to external platforms immediately.

- [ ] **Stripe Foundation:** Implement processing for **Adoption Fee Invoices** (Fixed $300/$250) and **General One-Time Donations**.
- [ ] **Petfinder & RescueGroups Sync:** Build a background Go job to auto-export our `IPet` database to external APIs nightly.
- [ ] **Basic E-Ink Infrastructure:** Deploy Raspberry Pi Pico 2W units to kennels to display dynamic "Digital Kennel Cards" (Name, Breed, QR Code).

## 🎟️ Phase 3: Engagement Campaigns

**Goal:** Turn passive followers into active donors through gamification.

- [ ] **"Name the Litter" Campaigns:** A voting mechanism where donors pay $5 to suggest or vote on names for new litters.
- [ ] **Digital Raffle Manager:** A dedicated module to sell raffle tickets via Stripe and randomly select winners during events.
- [ ] **Pet Record Management (CRUD):** Build the Admin Dashboard view to Create, Read, Update, and Delete pet profiles efficiently.

## 🤝 Phase 4: Onboarding & Communication

**Goal:** Streamline the adopter journey and automate follow-ups.

- [ ] **Adopter Onboarding:** Automate "Welcome Home" emails containing PDF care guides triggered immediately upon adoption.
- [ ] **Foster-to-Adopt Fast-Track:** A "Keep Them" button in the Foster Portal that skips application review and immediately triggers the adoption invoice.
- [ ] **SMS Integration:** Connect a privacy-focused SMS provider to send automated "Application Received" text alerts.

## 📱 Phase 5: Mobile & Field Operations (PWA)

**Goal:** Empower volunteers to work offline and in the field.

- [ ] **Offline "Field Mode":** Enable PWA capabilities so Intake Coordinators can fill out forms in areas with poor cell service.
- [ ] **Push Notifications:** Implement web push notifications to alert fosters of urgent needs.
- [ ] **"Add to Home Screen":** Optimize the web manifest to encourage volunteers to install IDOHR as a native-feeling app.

## 🔄 Phase 6: Financial Stability

**Goal:** Convert one-time interactions into recurring support.

- [ ] **Monthly Subscriptions:** Enable recurring giving options in Stripe.
- [ ] **Pet Sponsorships:** Logic linking a recurring payment to a specific `petId` to fund their medical care.
- [ ] **The "Gotcha Day" Engine:** An automated job that sends "Happy 1st Anniversary" emails to adopters.

## 📺 Phase 7: Advanced Hardware

**Goal:** Integrate digital displays deeply into shelter workflows.

- [ ] **Intake Kiosk (E-Ink Level 2):** A larger display at the intake desk for immediate data entry (weight/intake details).
- [ ] **Vet Appointment Display:** An office dashboard screen showing the next 48 hours of medical appointments.
- [ ] **Device Health Monitor:** An admin view to track battery levels and connectivity status of all deployed Raspberry Pi units.

## 📊 Phase 8: Data & Inventory

**Goal:** Improve animal outcomes through better data tracking.

- [ ] **Weight Visualization:** Interactive charts on Pet Profiles to track kitten growth curves and auto-flag weight loss.
- [ ] **Inventory Tracking:** A "Supply Closet" system where volunteers can flag low stock, automatically updating a public "Wishlist" for donors.
- [ ] **Medication Audit Logs:** "Mark as Given" buttons for volunteers to prevent double-dosing.

## 🧩 Phase 9: Matchmaking & Discovery

**Goal:** Reduce decision fatigue and help adopters find the right fit.

- [ ] **"Find My Match" Quiz:** An interactive wizard that filters the pet database by lifestyle (Energy Level, Good with Kids, etc.).
- [ ] **"Pet Alerts":** Users can subscribe to specific criteria (e.g., "Notify me when a Calico Kitten becomes available").
- [ ] **Lifestyle Badges:** Automated logic that tags pet profiles with badges like "Apartment Friendly".

## 🏙️ Phase 10: Community Resources

**Goal:** Position IDOHR as a community hub, not just a shelter.

- [ ] **Lost & Found Generator:** A public tool allowing community members to upload lost pet info and generate a printable PDF flyer.
- [ ] **Volunteer "Skill Swap":** A directory of volunteer professional skills (e.g., Lawyer, Plumber, CPA).
- [ ] **Community Calendar:** A public view of adoption events, fundraisers, and vaccine clinics.

## 🕊️ Phase 11: Specialized Care & Crisis

**Goal:** Support the most vulnerable populations and manage emergencies.

- [ ] **"SOS" Volunteer Broadcast:** A filtered alert system to text volunteers who are marked as "Available Today" for urgent needs.
- [ ] **Fospice (Hospice) Tracker:** A "Quality of Life" daily log for terminally ill pets.
- [ ] **Smart Visiting Hours:** A live website widget displaying "Open for Visits" or "Quiet Time" based on feeding schedules.

## 🌟 Phase 12: Security, Performance & Legacy

**Goal:** Harden the application to enterprise standards.

- [ ] **High-Security Auth (Passkeys):** Implement WebAuthn so admins can log in with FaceID/TouchID.
- [ ] **"Zero-Dependency" Audit:** Remove non-essential libraries to ensure long-term maintainability.
- [ ] **Accessibility Certification:** Ensure full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- [ ] **Legacy Giving Portal:** Information and forms for bequests and wills.

## 💎 Phase 13: SaaS Monetization & Access Control

**Goal:** Refactor the codebase to support multi-tenancy and enforce usage limits for paying customers.

- [ ] **Tenant Logic:** Update database schema to associate every record with an `organization_id` to support multiple shelters.
- [ ] **Usage Metering Middleware:** Implement backend logic to count active resources (Admins, Active Volunteers, Storage) and block actions if limits are exceeded.
  - _Example:_ Block adding a 4th Admin if on Free Plan.
  - _Example:_ Block SMS API calls if pre-paid credits are 0.
- [ ] **Billing Portal:** Create a "Super Admin" dashboard for shelter directors to view their usage stats, pay invoices, and manage payment methods via Stripe Customer Portal.
- [ ] **Feature Gating:** Wrap premium components (like "Heatmaps" or "Advanced Analytics") in permission checks that verify the organization's subscription status.
